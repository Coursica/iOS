# CS 182 Final Project Instructions
- The project is contained within a project I did for CS50.
- Run the project by cloning this repo, and opening the Coursica.xcworkspace with Xcode 7, and clicking the play button in the top-left corner.
- Getting the app to run may require installing [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
- The relevant code is contained in the files Factor.swift, FactorChecker.swift, Schedule.swift, Variable.swift, and AppDelegate.swift
- Within AppDelegate.Swift, CS 182 code is between lines 245 and 456.
- The local search will run when the app starts up and print its output to the console. After it terminates the app will crash due to a database error, but this should not effect any of the CS 182 code.
