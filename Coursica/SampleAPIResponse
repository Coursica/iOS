        "notes": "Undergraduates, GSAS students, and cross-registered students may take CS50 either Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (SAT/UNS) or for a letter grade. To take CS50 SAT/UNS, register for catalog number 43861. To take CS50 for a letter grade, register for catalog number 4949. When taken for a letter grade, this course meets the General Education requirement for undergraduates for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. See course\\'s website for FAQs. This course will also meet on Fri 9/5 and Fri 10/17. Students with conflicts may watch those lectures online."
