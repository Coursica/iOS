We read just the right amount of each philosopher in the course so that it feels like you have an understanding of their main views without having to dig deep. Simmons makes lectures fun and engaging, although it felt like it slowed down a bit in the middle of the semester. And a lot of people were dissatisfied with section.

Prof. Simmons makes reading Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant very accessible. Also, Olivia is a wonderful TF, and she really knows her stuff. \r\n\r\nOn a side note, as a Social Studies concentrator, knowing about Kant's and Locke's epistemology helped me better appreciate their political writings. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               If you want to get a taste of philosophy, this is the best course to get that taste. Alison is one of the most likable, approachable, and pedagogically excellent professors at Harvard. You will probably have a huge professor crush on her by the end of the course. There is so much support for students in helping them learn how to write philosophy. It's very clearly an intro course and the teaching staff are acutely aware that people are here to learn the tools of philosophy. Please don't let hard grades be the reason why you don't take this. It's really not that bad, and your GPA is never a reason not to take an excellent course. This will help you become a more lucid thinker. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               It shows you what people had thought about in regards to the limit and ability of human understanding!

But despite being an introductory course, students are still forced to engage deeply and grapple with challenging questions, and I felt like I grew a lot over the semester from engaging with this material. It's also a great introduction to how to write philosophy papers. Professor Simmons is an incredible teacher -- lectures are fantastic and she is extremely willing to engage with students outside of class; I got so much out of going to her office hours over the course of the semester, and highly recommend going if you take this class.

This is a well-presented introduction to some major philosophers, as well as quandaries which still affect our thought today. The writings and readings are short, but dense and challenging.

There are 5 papers and a Final, so it's definitely a lot of work, but super worth it (to be honest I enjoyed writing the papers). The final also bring everything together and the AH-HA moment you were waiting for all semester occurs. That being said, section was atrocious. The grading wasn't bad but dear lord Richard was so confusing and disorganized that section made my guts churn. If they get better TF's for the course, it will be THE intro course to Phil. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This might be one of the best classes you will take at Harvard. Prof. Simmon's lectures are amazing, at the end of lecture I would almost always wish we had more time (and I don't say that lightly!). If you are at all interested in philosophy or history of philosophy you will not regret taking this course. I highly recommend taking advantage of office hours. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This is an absolutely wonderful class that I cannot recommend highly enough and was my favorite this year. Alison Simmons is an excellent professor who makes some very difficult but very interesting readings accessible and exciting. The essays are 2-4 pages in length with very interesting prompts that push you to interact with the texts in a really cool way. This is a great course for prospective philosophy concentrators as it gets into some difficult material but requires no background in philosophy. Tip: go to office hours!

Essays are graded critically but your writing, and hopefully thinking, will become a lot more precise.

Read the textbook if you can, it adds to the course experience immensely and if I hadn't had two other science classes that took up tons of time I would have read more diligently. LS1b is not particularly challenging, and can seem like it is directed at a pre-college audience at times. At the end of the day, however, it is a positive experience. There is a sad truth that the final unit of LS1b is significantly worse than the other three, so as we all go into these evaluations we have a little bit of a bad taste in our mouths. But we must remember that LS1b had many great moments. All the professors are wonderful, and the first three are also great lecturers. Hopi and Pardis are special standouts. Maryellen is a great person, but here lectures this year were a little bit more of a fact-dump than real, engaging lectures. LS1b has a slight culture of pre-med grade craziness, which I personally found tragic but this is far from LS1b's fault. Pre-meds, please, if you don't actually care about biology then maybe medicine isn't the best career for you. Doctors are wonderful people, dedicated to caring and a better world; one would think that doctors, of all people, would see that there is more to life than grades. Anyway, LS1b is a great class. Take it, since you probably have to, enjoy the good parts (and there are many), waltz through the dreary parts with a smile on your face, and read the textbook to realize that biology might be cooler than you thought. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               The class tries to accomplish too much, it has apparently become better in past years but the material in lecture is not really related to the labs and the tests are rather hard.

Definitely not everything that people make it out to be. It's filled with premeds so you know what's coming. Lectures can be drawn out and boring but Eggan and Hoekstra are interesting. Sabeti tries to keep your interest by launching projectiles into the lecture hall. Bottom line: you are probably required to take it. Bite the bullet.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               First of all, unless you are 100% dead set on a concentration ending in \"biology,\" do not take this course. LS1b is not required for medical schools' general biology with lab requirement. Stop reading this Q guide page and go find another course that fulfills that requirement. Or go outside or something. Literally. Stop reading. Go find a better class. Trust me, it won't be hard.\r\n\r\nOk, you're still with me? Alright. First, don't buy the book. I made that mistake, spent $200 on it at the beginning of the semester, and never opened it. You don't need the book to do well in the class, and the money could probably be better spent on alco--wait I mean wholesome and character-building diversions. In fact, you don't really need all that much to do well except a basic understanding of biology, high school math, and the clairvoyance necessary to figure out what they're asking on psets and exams. This is where the hard part comes in - it's nearly impossible sometimes to divine what exact phrasing you'll need to get credit. Compounding this fact is that, for the most part, 80% of the material being tested comes from only 20% of the lecture. You'll end up tearing your hair out Sunday night poring through lecture notes and videos to find the 15-second segment that answers your pset question. It's also very frustrating to get exams back with lots of points marked off not lots of explanation as to why; presumably, it's because the answer written didn't correspond exactly with what was on the answer key (general tip - if your class sends your exams to someone other than your TF for grading, run). Aside from the mind-reading, though, the class is frustratingly easy. It's hard to take a class seriously when you're being told by a MacArthur Fellow how to calculate simple probabilities or by a Rhodes Scholar what a log scale is. On that note, your professors will be brilliant, but only some of them (Hopi and Pardis) can really teach. So that means for half the semester, you'll have to listen to either a boring (Kevin) or - and I'm not sure how this combination is possible, but I guess it is - boring and condescending lecturer (Maryellen). The GDP project is also pretty much a disaster. It forces you to spend inordinate amounts of time searching on the internet for the answer to questions that not even real honest-to-god scientists know the answer to, plus you're being graded 95% on how good at citation you are and 5% on the laughably vague parameter of \"style.\" Oh, and each part is equal to several psets in credit, so, you know, don't screw up.\r\n\r\nSection was also pretty lackluster, and I LIKED my TF. You end up doing the same sequence of discussion/lab week in and week out, and neither is particularly worth the repetition. The discussion - while helpful for figuring out exactly which small fraction of lecture is actually going to be tested - drags on for far too long and ends up compressing the time you have for lab. But that's okay because, in addition to not being relevant to what's being taught in lecture after the first few weeks, lab is nothing more than pipetting liquids into other liquids (sometimes they're colored--ooh!), running what seems like a million gels, and the occasional \"why am I here\" exercise, like the one where you are a \"predator\" \"hunting\" for \"prey\", aka beads in a box, constrained by the terrible and dastardly obstacle of--yup, you guessed it--turning the lights off. Really. \r\n\r\nSo, to recap: if you enjoy buying unnecessarily expensive textbooks, poorly phrased questions that don't reflect the material being taught, weirdly inexplicable grading, soporific lectures, spending lots of time with your graphing calculator, not getting to use any of the cool yet relevant functions on your graphing calculator, meaningless labs, getting to know your friendly local centrifuge, long walks on the beach, and poorly phrased questions, then LS1b may be right for you! #ohgodpleasedonttakethiscourse\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               It's very difficult and requires a strong science background.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Unless it it necessary for your concentration, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Unfortunately LS1b is a requirement for many life sciences majors.

The professors and the Peer Study Leaders are very helpful, but do not expect much support from the preceptors/TF's.

The GDP project was interesting, but the lack of a rubric made it extremely difficult as you could obtain a variety of information from anywhere on the world wide web. The class also had a very weird timeline as they assigned problem sets and labs during awkward times like reading period when you have a variety of other finals to work on.

A broad range of topics are covered, which was very helpful for me because I knew I wanted to concentrate in one of the life sciences, but this allowed me to determine which particular subjects I was most interested in. You get four different lecturers for six lectures each, and each has their own particular style so if you don't like one as much, you'll be moving on to the next one in a few lectures anyway. All of the teaching staff and extra resources, such as the Friday problem solving lectures were very helpful, though I didn't feel the need to go to them all that often, and I didn't use the textbook at all.

The structure of the course and the teaching staff is largely the same, so you know the deal. My only advice would be to try to stay on top of the lectures/material early in the semester so you don't fall too far behind. Because almost everyone who takes PS3 has taken PS2, they dive right into the material during shopping week, so before you know it you can find yourself behind on the material.

The concepts themselves are often less intuitive than those of PS2, but the calculations themselves tended to be easier and more straightforward. Even when the lecture material is challenging to grasp, it is always possible to understand by simply going back and reading Logan's lecture notes, which are posted after each lecture. The homework is pretty short (probably 2-5 hours a week depending on your speed) and the questions are very relevant to lecture material.

Logan is one of the best professors I have ever had at Harvard - he is able to make the material interesting and exciting, and he brings energy to every single class and meeting.

You should expect much fewer course materials and support than in PS3, such as additional practice problems and reviews. The homeworks are, in my opinion, easier than the ones in PS2, but the problems done in section were often irrelevant. The course material itself was often interesting in its applications, for example, MRI and corrective lenses, but those lectures also ended up adding confusing and irrelevant information to the course material that cropped up later on. The exam averages were higher than in PS2, and I thought the exams were fair, but I did not think they were easy. They still allow cheat sheets during exams, which is the saving grace. Overall, the course is interesting because Logan is teaching it and he's fantastic, and there are some really cool demonstrations during the lectures, but the course needs more materials available for students to practice. If you bought the book (which I did), you will never know how to use it to your advantage, except for blindly flipping through it to try to find practice problems that are relevant. And often on the homeworks it is difficult to figure out where the formulas you are supposed to be using are coming from, and because of the lack of materials available from the course, I often used google.

A particular shout out to DAVID, CRISTINA and KRISTINA for literally being the best TFs I have ever had. I wish more premed classes learnt from PS2/3. As far as doing well in the course is concerned, treat sapling as the basic elements that you need to know to progress onto the written pset.

Really. Back when I was a wee freshman, reading Q evaluations about SS10b and pondering \"how could this course be as transformative and life-changing as everyone says it is?\", I never would have anticipated having grown or learned this much. Now, thousands of pages and more deep discussions than I can count later, I really do feel like I see the world in an entirely new way. I've learned to question the status quo and challenge the way things are; every day, in my real life interactions, I am reminded of the readings and discussions we had in tutorial. After all, as civilized humans, I think it's tremendously important to learn about how society shapes us and how we can find meaning from that. But I don't want to give away too much :) For now, I'll just end with this: Social Studies 10b is exactly the kind of course I dreamed of taking upon coming to Harvard, and I'm so, SO glad I did.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               The SS10b tutorial is even better than 10a.  \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               I loved the material of this course AND I loved the way it was taught ('supplementary' lecture and small house tutorials).

Also, lecture this semester was much better than those given by Tuck...they often actually clarified the readings rather than confusing me more. This is the best and most rewarding course I've taken at Harvard, which has mostly to do with the fact that my tutor, Libby, was amazing, so I loved my tutorial. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Like Soc Stud 10a, the lectures are dry and boring, but the tutorial is great.

I feel very lucky that Professor Mehta taught the course this year, as his lectures are wonderfully clear, and seem less constrained by personal opinions than those of Tuck. Though I'm not entirely sure what 10b would look and feel like in the future without Professor Mehta, I think it would still be very worthwhile.

Very Very tough. It could be smoother but I think there are a couple of logistical issues that make it difficult. The first is the lack of application to problems during lecture/section. I really think that there should be either a longer section or more application of mechanisms during class. The second thing that makes this class absolutely difficult is these friday reviews. If you have class and or cannot make it during the review then you can say goodbye to being able to do well on the pset becaues this is considered the \"application\" portion of the class. for a class that stresses the importance of the review they do a horrible job in making sure it goes online before psets are due so you end up struggling throughout the entire pset.

I went essentially from no chemistry knowledge besides what LS1a had taught me to being able to carry out reasonably complicated syntheses and figuring out the mechanisms behind complex molecular rearrangements. Chem 20 is brutal, frustrating, overwhelming, and then just absolutely wonderful. While I have obviously never taken the Chem 17/27 sequence (though I will probably take 27) I would say that if one sincerely wants to learn Chem 20/30 is the way to go. The teaching staff is brilliant and caring, there are plenty of resources for practice, and the class works together in a lovely way. The number of super intelligent science kids in the class was rather amusing as well- both inspiring and humbling. I would say I am one of the rarer cases of people who take organic chemistry in that I am not pre-med, not a chemistry major, and may not pursue a science career. I was primarily excited to take organic chem because I think the molecules are incredibly beautiful and seeing how they interact seemed like a fascinating thing to study. The class definitely requires a good command of spatial skills/drawing, and these skills were the hardest for me to develop. Though, I can now draw a mean hexagon. Chem 20 will certainly take over your semester, so watch out for too many tough classes at the same time- I am rather guilty of packing myself with too much to the second semester of freshman year. Yet, Chem 20 is totally worth it. Really, really worth it. It's one of those rare classes where you finish the semester and realize \"Wow, I learned so much\". And one doesn't learn it superficially, either. Ryan (SUCH a good professor) is right when he says organic chemistry is like a language class. Just like learning to read, you will finish Chem 20 and never be able to look at molecules the same again. That is such a beautiful feeling. So take Chem 20, avoid the pre-med rush in the 17/27 pipeline, and relish the opportunity to learn from some of the best teachers you can find.

This is a superbly run and superbly taught class that will challenge you and push your limits, but at the end of the semester I guarantee you'll be shocked at how much you've learned. Ryan is an excellent lecturer, and all of the TFs do their utmost to ensure that you're keeping up with the material. Seriously - the amount of support offered in this class borders on the ridiculous, as does the amount of time you'll be spending on the course.

This is an extremely well taught class with a bunch of resources to help you, and a fantastic level of rigor! Although there are times where you'll feel very frustrated, it all pays off in the end.

The papers test your grip on the material (instead of asking you to focus on your own nuanced theory, which can be very difficult for undergrad students).

However, if you want to get to know a few stats professors better and to practice writing and speaking a lot, this is definitely for you.

The skills you develop in this tutorial can also be used in most statistical positions (internships, post-grad employment, etc.) as well though. Expect to spend more time on this class as the semester goes by and as assignments become more intensive. I highly recommend going to office hours as well. It will be more individually focused, and you'll get a lot more feedback than you get during the 2 hour class.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This course did better prepare me for a thesis in some ways, but there are many aspects of the course that could use some improvement such as the consistency in comments and support from course instructors. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This class has some really great elements, the best of which in my opinion is the fact that you get a small, discussion-based class in a department that usually has you taking lecture classes, and you get to hang out with the department head and hear from some really interesting people. Some of the assignments were also fun to do, and it does force you to learn to use Latex if you haven't already. The reason I would recommend this class with reservations is because it definitely wasn't what I expected; having a tutorial junior spring made myself and a lot of others think that this class was geared toward helping you figure out how to write a thesis, or choose a topic, and that definitely wasn't it. It's a very interesting class, but if you're not interested in writing statistical papers or running simulation studies, you probably won't enjoy 98 too much, and you really don't NEED this class for anything going forward, so don't just take it because it's the junior tutorial. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               It is a very rigorous course with constant deadlines and demands, but is useful if you are looking to learn more about how to write and talk about statistics. It is not a course where you will necessarily get started on narrowing a topic or finding data for a thesis.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Really challenging class but really rewarding.

Lecture and Section were always interesting and fun.  Kiran is very easy to be around and very funny.  Lectures and sections with the TFs were spent laughing and learning, as classes should be.  The material is was completely knew to me yet I was able to understand it very well with Kiran's amazing teaching style and my TFs wealth of knowledge.  The class is not challenging if you attend or view all the lectures and tests and problem sets are very straightforward.  No reason to be worried to take this class if you keep up with the lectures and engage in section discussions.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This was one of the best courses I took at Harvard (and I am a non-science concentrator). Kiran is a great lecturer, all the materials are available online or in person, and sections are taught in case format. The teaching staff is incredibly accessible and supportive. Problem sets and exams are interesting and very fair. What you get out of this course is definitely based on what you put into it (go to office hours!), but you can learn the information in many different formats, all of which are offered by the teaching staff. I cannot recommend a course more highly!

Take it alongside Chem 27 and your understanding on biochemistry will drastically improve.

Kiran is such a thoughtful, caring professor. He is the only professor I know who knows the name of EVERY SINGLE STUDENT in a class of like 80-100 students. He brings cookies to sections for everyone and constantly adapts the course to make it better for students. He rotates between the sections so that he can teach each one and get a sense of how students are responding to the material. \r\n\r\nLectures: ARE OPTIONAL. This means you can enroll in a class that technically conflicts with lectures because lectures are all pre-recorded withe lecture scripts posted so you can read word for word what he says with each slide (unlike other LS classes where the slides are just unhelpful pictures and you have no idea what's going on)\r\n\r\nProblem Sets: Started out as 30 questions then because it is a new course and doesn't have practice exams yet, he made the problem sets like 70-100 questions but they served as REALLY GOOD exam prep. The questions weren't that bad--mostly multiple or short answer, but they accurately reflected everything we needed to know for the exams. The answer keys also always had references to the lecture slides in which the answers could be found, which makes it really convenient for us to go back and learn from our mistakes without having to hound through hundreds of pages of notes.\r\n\r\nExams: Incredibly fair exams. Out of 3 midterms, you can drop your lowest one and if you feel comfortable with your grade, you don't even have to take the last midterm.  The first time I've ever walked out feeling confident and like I got to apply what I know. Unlike most science professors, Kiran doesn't feel the need to demoralize us by making the exams way harder than problem set questions. I know the fear is that students won't push themselves to learn beyond the material needed for the exam, and I know I can't speak for everyone, but personally, I found that people (myself included) still went to office hours and review sessions to ask big picture questions and delve into the details of metabolic processes. It doesn't make us less curious or inquisitive, in fact, knowing that the exams will be fair makes me feel more encouraged and willing to learn whereas in other LS classes, I sort of resign and give up because I know that no matter how hard I study, the exam will be impossible anyway. \r\n\r\nReview Sessions and Office Hours: GO TO THEM. Kiran outlines big picture processes and compares/contrasts concepts during review sessions. This sort of synthesis is incredibly helpful for understanding the material and doing well on the exams. Kiran is also so so kind about extending office hours and meeting outside of scheduled office hours and offering career/life advice. He's a really cool person--get to know him! \r\n\r\nTFs: Are also amazing. They are really patient and willing to stay past scheduled office hours and respond to emails promptly. They're really enthusiastic about the material and are cool because most of them are recent graduates who are really chill. They help guide you to the right answer without giving vague unhelpful responses or blatant answers. \r\n\r\nSection: Is pretty great because, as mentioned above, the TFs are awesome. Patient cases are really hard, and I often had no idea what was going on, but the concept of them is really cool because we get to apply what we know about the molecular mechanisms to try and try to diagnose the patient/understand how they manifest as physical symptoms. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This course does a good job of giving you a basic background in biochem. The MCAT is changing in 2015, so by the next time this class is offered the utility will be quite apparent if you're premed. The material is pretty interesting , and the course is structured so that you have a solid base of knowledge by the end. The sections are based on working through cases (you're given patient data and asked questions that lead you through diagnoses), and it's a fun way to apply the knowledge from the week. Take advantage of the fact that the lecture videos are online, because Kiran goes through a lot of material quickly. Speaking of Kiran, the cookies he orders from a shop in Maryland (he used to work at Johns Hopkins) are great; he gives them out in section at the beginning and end of the semester. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Easy course (this year), with very welcoming teaching staff and very accessible resources (lecture notes, scripts, problem sets). \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Kiran is an awesome professor and does a great job to make sure that the students do well in the course. He listens to feedback and actually makes changes to the class structure in order to make sure that students are learning the material. The midterm exams are fair and comes straight from the lecture materials. The patient cases that we go over in section also are really interesting and contribute to learning the material in a different way.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Biochem is the greatest premed class to take IMO. This class forms the foundations of modern medicine... if you're a cardiologist and you don't know that statins inhibit HMG coreductase to lower cholesterol levels... then??? Anyway, what I'm trying to say that you should take this class because 1) it's really chill - go to lecture or watch the video, plus they explain things on answer sets (they dont just leave you hanging... no surprises). 2) in section, it is taught in PBL clinical - basically if you're premed you get to apply ur biochem knowledge to clinical cases. Finally, a class at Harvard that illustrates the practical applications of the theoretical!!! Anyway, biochem is great. If you don't care much for mechanisms and want a class that will cover it so that you'll have (ideally) a systematic integrated understanding of most of the important pathways, take this class!!!

Kiran was incredibly invested in the course, and although the lectures were not necessarily the most interesting, he and the teaching staff really went above and beyond in trying to help everyone succeed. Section was easily the most interesting part of the course and I found the case studies to be where I really learned most of the material. Overall this is a relatively painless way to prepare for the MCAT and check off your biochemistry requirement. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Don't be stupid and get stuck at a 94% in this class.

The course is brilliant and interesting. It made me like the subject! The problem sets and exams are as fair as you could possibly ask for and if you do the problem sets you'll be completely fine on the exam. I can think of no reason why you would not want to take this course.

However, because it's so flexible, it's on you to watch all the lectures and read all the section cases if you want a thorough introduction to biochemistry. Although this course doesn't go into detailed biochemical pathways or chemical mechanisms--very little memorization required!-- I learned a general overview of many different pathways and found them all super interesting to learn about.

Kiran cares a ton about the course, and it shows in how much time he devotes to the class.

I did not enjoy organic chemistry and so at the start I was nervous that I also wouldn't enjoy biochemistry, but I actually really enjoyed the subject. Its really cool material since you are actually learning about the disease. Its also great preparation for medical school and the problem based learning method that the course uses in section is a good way for most pre meds to figure out whether or not they like that learning style. Exams and problems sets are all very fair, but the class does require that you invest time into learning the material.

It also gave me a much stronger understanding about climate change, how it works, how estimates are made, what the concerns/consequences of different changes are... this I think is the defining issue of our generation and so I really believe it is something every Harvard undergrad should leave here having learnt to understand.

There are a very few classes out there that I genuinely believe will change your life and the way you approach learning in general, and this is absolutely one of them. Regardless of your level of interest in astronomy, I think this class would be beneficial, but if you even have the most tangential interest in astronomy, physics, or outer space, you will absolutely adore this class. There were a few issues with the \"inverted classroom\" model that was implemented this year (pacing was really the only significant one), but the teaching staff (all of which was downright incredible) all were aware of them and I think next year the class will be even better.

That is, Prof. Johnson would lecture for at most 30 minutes, and the rest of the time would be dedicated to working on the pset while TFs walked around and helped anyone who needed it. I love this structure and think it should be more widely applied, so you should totally take this course. However, this is not an \"easy gen-ed\" and the psets can sometimes take a lot of time.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This class has changed a lot from previous years. Professor Johnson has introduced a completely new teaching style, where you get into groups and work through worksheets on blackboards situated around the classroom, instead of listening to lectures. Professor Johnson and the (very helpful) TFs circulate the room and help whenever your group gets stuck. At first, it seems really odd and you may feel a bit nervous and put on the spot, but it is an effective way to learn as long as you buy into it. You and your group will feel very connected by the end of the year, and the TFs are always there to help when you get stuck (and you will get stuck... a lot). I was surprised by how much I actually learned, and the exams were a great way to demonstrate this. The material is so interesting, and the night labs are super cool. Using the Clay Telescope (the REAL telescope on the roof of the Science Center... not the crappy one that anyone can get swipe access to) was definitely a highlight of the course for me, and it was great to learn how to operate a professional-grade telescope and all the companion software. Instead of handing in problem sets, you will make blog posts every week of the problems on the worksheets and some 'freeform' posts about whatever you find interesting about astrophysics in the news or in general. This was the first year of the new version of Astro 16, so there were some kinks in the process, but overall it was very good and I learned a lot. Definitely recommend this course!\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This class is fantastic because the TFs, Marion, Luke, Zack, and John, as well as professor Johnson, are fantastic. While the hands-on, complete-the-problem-sets-in-class format might seem off-putting, it is key to understanding the more complicated concepts as you get immediate help from TFs, and can work through issues with your partners. Definitely take this class if you are interested in the material, and learning about some seriously cool things. I loved it. Nevertheless, it is not an easy A, and significant work is necessary to make sure you integrate the concepts once class is over. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               The staff in this class truly care a lot about teaching it and helping you learn and the small class and unusual method of teaching are really great.

I think this will be fixed in future iterations of the class as the first time is always one of the hardest.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               You'll get frustrated with the systemic parts of the class, sometimes homework is ambiguous and there is poor communication. However, class itself is remarkably enjoyable, it's presented in a novel way, and you walk away knowing some really wonderful things about the universe.

The setup of the course itself is quite unconventional -- in class you work through problems in groups, and for homework you write blog posts on these problems, on labs, and on topics of your choice. Class time feels well spent, and writing blog posts can be fun if you enjoy putting effort into the presentation of your work. However, this course also has take home examinations that do not allow the use of a calculator. These exams were tedious and excessively time consuming, albeit reasonable in difficultly. Overall, this is an excellent course and highly recommended for those with even a casual interest in astronomy. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This class is awesome even if you're not a physics/astro concentrator\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               I loved this class!

I really enjoyed working in small groups and solving problems at the board. I think this format works really well with this class. But, sometimes the TF's would give conflicting advice while solving a problem. This was very frustrating because we would start solving a problem one way, under the advisement of one TF, and then another would come over and tell us it was wrong. Also the take home assessments sucked because they took forever. The teaching staff way underestimated the time it would us to solve the problems because I have talked to many people and it took everyone forever. Overall this class was super cool and I really enjoyed the format. Just start your blog posts early as they take longer than you may think.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               The topics covered are really interested, but the way the class is taught is quite different - you have to find a way that make it works for you.

Put time into finishing the assignments ahead of time.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               The labs are awesome, and it's a great gateway to astronomy if that's a field you're interested in; if you're not sure about astronomy though, take this course anyway! The work was done in groups, which was a new style to me, so if you don't understand something, it's easy to get help from someone who does. I feel that I learned a lot about the universe, but I also feel that I still don't quite fully grasp everything that I learned. The course would be better with a stronger lecture component, which it will hopefully have next year. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Great class, very informative, would love to have many classes like this.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This class is an interesting and fun way to be introduced to astronomy. Its unusual inverted lecture format is an acquired taste: shop it and decide for yourself if you find it alright. I had a lot of fun taking this class, and rarely felt like I was working because my hardest problem-solving was done in class with a support network of the professor and TFs. \n                             "], "faculty": {"Johnson, John Asher": {"Accessible Outside Class": {"breakdown": [0, 4, 4, 6, 6], "median": 4, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 4.140635, "group": 4.0135136, "dept": 4.0135136, "size": 4.2592087}, "three_years": {"division": 4.124577, "group": 4.191489, "dept": 4.191489, "size": 4.235396}}, "mean": 3.7}, "Instructor Overall": {"breakdown": [0, 1, 5, 6, 8], "median": 4, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 3.970025, "group": 4.1860466, "dept": 4.1860466, "size": 4.22333}, "three_years": {"division": 4.008697, "group": 4.293567, "dept": 4.293567, "size": 4.2157526}}, "mean": 4.05}, "Generates Enthusiasm": {"breakdown": [0, 1, 1, 0, 18], "median": 5, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 4.1336575, "group": 4.445783, "dept": 4.445783, "size": 4.3697023}, "three_years": {"division": 4.151085, "group": 4.460772, "dept": 4.460772, "size": 4.34481}}, "mean": 4.75}, "Returns Assignments in Timely Fashion": {"breakdown": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2], "median": 4, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 4.1843114, "group": 4.133333, "dept": 4.133333, "size": 4.250542}, "three_years": {"division": 4.129357, "group": 4.2438273, "dept": 4.2438273, "size": 4.2540126}}, "mean": 3.8}, "Gives Useful Feedback": {"breakdown": [0, 1, 4, 3, 2], "median": 3.5, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 4.1041017, "group": 4.0, "dept": 4.0, "size": 4.256}, "three_years": {"division": 4.011982, "group": 4.116848, "dept": 4.116848, "size": 4.202209}}, "mean": 3.6}, "Facilitates Discussion & Encourages Participation": {"breakdown": [0, 0, 3, 2, 15], "median": 5, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 4.1209974, "group": 4.19403, "dept": 4.19403, "size": 4.251217}, "three_years": {"division": 4.0783124, "group": 4.3164763, "dept": 4.3164763, "size": 4.2377095}}, "mean": 4.6}, "Effective Lectures or Presentations": {"breakdown": [2, 2, 3, 5, 7], "median": 4, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 3.9946177, "group": 4.181818, "dept": 4.181818, "size": 4.245865}, "three_years": {"division": 4.0297155, "group": 4.3085713, "dept": 4.3085713, "size": 4.222233}}, "mean": 3.6842105263157894}}}}}, "ANTHRO 97x: Sophomore Tutorial in Archaeology": {"spring2012": {"term": "spring", "title": "ANTHRO 97x: Sophomore Tutorial in Archaeology", "enrollment": "8", "year": "2012", "answers": {"Feedback": {"breakdown": [1, 0, 2, 1, 1], "median": 3, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 3.847365, "group": 4.263158, "dept": 4.263158, "size": 4.2527356}, "three_years": {"division": 3.7749414, "group": 3.8879669, "dept": 3.8879669, "size": 4.241464}}, "mean": 3.2}, "Would You Recommend": {"breakdown": [0, 1, 1, 2, 1], "median": 4, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 4.060502, "group": 4.2988048, "dept": 4.2988048, "size": 4.317113}, "three_years": {"division": 4.037788, "group": 4.0962696, "dept": 4.0962696, "size": 4.312463}}, "mean": 3.6}, "Assignments": {"breakdown": [0, 2, 1, 1, 1], "median": 3, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 3.9315343, "group": 4.266129, "dept": 4.266129, "size": 4.1968703}, "three_years": {"division": 3.875619, "group": 3.929697, "dept": 3.929697, "size": 4.1800528}}, "mean": 3.2}, "Course Overall": {"breakdown": [0, 1, 1, 2, 1], "median": 4, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 3.978575, "group": 4.2151394, "dept": 4.2151394, "size": 4.285858}, "three_years": {"division": 3.9255707, "group": 3.9559119, "dept": 3.9559119, "size": 4.2702537}}, "mean": 3.6}, "Materials": {"breakdown": [0, 0, 2, 2, 1], "median": 4, "mean": 3.8}, "Workload (hours per week)": {"breakdown": [1, 4, 0, 0, 0], "median": 2, "baselines": {"single_term": {"division": 2.1682107, "group": 2.2031872, "dept": 2.2031872, "size": 2.3398945}, "three_years": {"division": 2.201868, "group": 2.0596955, "dept": 2.0596955, "size": 2.3247774}}, "mean": 1.8}}, "comments": ["\n                               \n                               You have to take it if you are an Archaeology concentrator.

Some prepare awesome review packets while some are fairly uninteresting and don't do much to make the course discussions lively. Knowledge of the assumptions of modern classical economics is vital, but any intro economics course is likely doomed to be at least moderately boring.

The class is truly comprehensive, covering Roman history from 753 BC to 395 AD, and succeeds in covering that much time in a way that didn't feel too rushed. The research paper was a great opportunity to explore a topic I was interested in in-depth.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would mention, though, is that there is a very high volume/number of assignments in this course. Towards the end of the course, there was a flurry of quizzes, assignments related to the paper, section assignments, and sometimes 3 sets of readings per week. I felt that that volume wasn't particularly helpful.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This is a great class that gives you a comprehensive introduction to ancient Roman history. \n                             ", "\n                               \n                               Watch out - definitely take it pass fail if you can\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               If you're deciding between this and 97a because you don't have to take both, take 97a.\n                             ", "\n                               \n                               This is a wonderful class!

The reading pace is a little unrealistic in my opinion, you'll be assigned 250 a week by the end of the semester.
